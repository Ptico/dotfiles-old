My configuration files. Include colouring for iTerm (thnx to Dmytro Shteflyuk) and TextMate theme.

== Installator usage:

  ./install.rb
<tt>
install, setup        - Install dotfiles in your home directory.
         [--force]    - Rewrite target if exist
         [--symlink]  - Create symlinks instead of copy files
remove, delete        - Remove dotfiles
         [--force]    - Remove without confirmation for each file
</tt>

== Goodies:

*iTerm-swamp.sh* â€” swamp color theme for iTerm
Close your iTerm and run script in Terminal.app

*Swamp.tmTheme* - swamp color theme for TextMate
